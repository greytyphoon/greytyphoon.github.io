            This rule is based on a comment on some thread on 
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/2kybpy/house_rule_thread_house_rule_thread/clpzu4z">reddit.com/r/pathfinder_rpg</a>
            about houserules. It was short, barely noticed, but inspiring. Thanks Reddit!

        <!--Making Races Flexible-->
        <h6>Making Races Flexible</h6>
        <div class="float-right apartee">
            <b>Physical Stats:</b>
            STR, DEX, CON<br>
            <b>Mental Stats:</b>
            INT, WIS, CHA
        </div>
        <div class="br">
            A large portion of races have +2 to a physical stat, +2 to a mental stat, and -2 to another stat.<br/>
            <div class="circumstancialBonus br">
                For example, Halflings have +2 dex, +2 cha, -2 str.
            </div>
            With this rule, when choosing a race described above, you can choose to move one of your "+2".<br/>
            If you move the +2 from a physical stat, you have to move it to a physical stat.<br/>
            If you move the +2 from a mental stat, you have to move it to a mental stat.<br/>
            <div class="circumstancialBonus br">
                For example, Halflings could have +2 dex, +2 int, -2 str.
            </div>
            This can be used to cancel out your penalty.
            <div class="circumstancialBonus br">
                For example, Halflings could have +2 cha and nothing else.
            </div>
            Either the physical stat bonus or mental stat bonus can be moved, but not both. One has to stay.<br/>
            The penalty cannot be moved. It can be filled as described above, but not moved.<br/>
            If an alternate race trait would replace your bonus to a stat, you would not be considered a race with [+2p, +2m, -2] anymore, so this rule could not be used along with that alternate race trait.<br/>
            The choice is made at character creation, and once it is made it cannot be changed, even by retraining.
            <div class="circumstancialBonus br">
                Even if you become an Undead and your +2 CON is suddenly useless.<br/>
                As usual, the DM may override things on occasion.
            </div>
            If you are using this rule, you may be asked more details in the background of your character.

        <!--Why-->
        <h6>Why?</h6>
        <div class="br">
            This rule is meant to encourage creative and new uses of the races.<br/>
            It should make more colourful and varied characters, as well as break stereotypes about non-human races. Humans are defined by their variance, but members of other races aren't always exactly the same, either.<br/>
            Also, humans still have the addictive advantage of an extra feat, I don't believe this makes them obsolete.<br>
            <br>
            This rule will often be used together with "Core Races Only".
            <div class="circumstancialBonus">
                Non-Core races are often there to fill a niche of stats, and will regularly be chosen as such, i.e. "I need a race with +2 STR and +2 CHA for my paladin".<br/>
                Even when they're not used for power-gaming, they can be hard to integrate to a party, hard to keep in character, and hard to fit in a world.<br/>
                I'd rather have more standard races, to simplifiy social interactions, and this rule still gives players lots of customization, background hooks, options, and the stats they need.
