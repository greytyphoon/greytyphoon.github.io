		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to Venture TTRPG! It's a project I'm starting, a sort of concurrent to PF2.
			Something's off with PF2 for me, it's just not satisfying. I'm developping a game to scratch that itch, and to understand better. Hopefully it's playable too!
			PF2 is my base for this project, and many things are straight copied. If you can't find how to do something, default to PF2 rules for now.
		</p>

		<details class="br">
			<summary class="subtitle">[In Details] Purify design by removing elements</summary>
			<p>
				I'm trying to see how much I can remove while still keeping characters unique. "Unique" characters matter, it's the whole point.
				Removing rules means less barriers to entry, though, and it means we can break free of some notions that might have been holding us back.
				As such, many things are removed, simplified, or kept in name only.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Ability Scores</b> were just grouping some skills, but it was so subjective! If you're good at Religion, you'll be okay at Nature? Please. Not having them is one less pitfall for newbie players to fall in (Rogue w/ 18 Cha will have a hard time).</li>
				<li><b>Ancestries, Backgrounds, Classes</b></li>
				<li><b>Spontaneous vs Prepared spellcasting</b></li>
				<li><b>Spellcasting Traditions</b> (Arcane, Divine, Occult, Primal) It's just fluff now.</li>
				<li><b>Feats (of all kinds)</b></li>
				<li><b>Specific Weapons</b></li>
				<li><b>Specific Spells</b></li>
				<li><b>Low-light vision</b> if everyone has is, it's just complicated for nothing. Scrap.</li>

		<h2>Character creation: Skills</h2>
		<p>
			In Venture, everything is a skill. See the full list in the sidebar.
			You'll notice that even HP (Stamina), Fortitude, Reflex, and Weapons are now skills.
			That's because it all follows the TEML Proficiency system, so everything has been regrouped.
			Now when you roll a D20, it's a skill check.
		</p>
		<p>Perception has been removed in favor of 5E's Insight and Investigate.</p>
		<p>Arcana, Occultism, etc have been replaced with the specific schools of magic. Every spellcaster must become trained in a school to cast its spells.</p>
		<p>
			Your score in each skill is determined by three factors:<br>
			1) your level, but not the full value, it gives a bonus similar to 5E,<br>
			2) your proficiency, where Trained/Expert/Master/Legendary proficiency gives +3/5/6/7,<br>
			3) having an Edge, which represents your character's greatest strength, giving an extra +1.
		</p>
		<p>
			TEML is very similar to PF2's system.
			We are keeping the rule that limits being an Expert to level 2+, Master to level 7+, Legendary to level 15+.
			The proficiencies are +3/5/6/7 instead of +2/4/6/8 to feel more varied, to have a bigger impact when you get trained (PF1's initial +3 was nice!), and to limit the advantage of legendary proficiency (caps at +7, not +8).
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a technicality with Weapons and Armors:
			if you want to be Expert at Martial Weapons, you must be Expert at Simple weapons;
			similarly, if you want to be Expert at Exotic Weapons, you must be Expert at Martial weapons.
		</p>

		<h2>Character creation: Mechanics</h2>
		<p>
			As you create your character, you'll pick three Mechanics.
			Mechanics are rules which only your character has access to,
			which might give you a special Reaction,
			resources you can spend to gain some kind of advantage,
			or special senses or movements.
		</p>

		<h2>Character creation: Quirks</h2>
		<p>
			Every character gets two quirks.
			They have less effects than full-fledged Mechanics, but help characters feel unique.
			For now, the only Quirks I've thought of are 1) get an Edge on a skill, 2) get Darkvision.
		</p>

		<h2>Playing the game</h2>
		<p>
			Hastily adding this section to say a few things:
			1) everyone can use Attacks of Opportunity,
			2) everyone gets a free Step every turn if they don't otherwise move,
			3) we're still doing the "3 actions per turn",
			4) multi-attack penalty is still a thing,
			5) +10 is crit, -10 is fumble, is still a thing.
		</p>

		<h2>TO DO</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Write down how "Stamina" tells you how many HP you have</li>
			<li>Details of Conditions (including Dying and Wounded)</li>
			<li>Weapons Traits: how they work with Exotic/Martial/Simple, create some examples</li>
			<li>Create and detail some Mechanics</li>
			<li>Create some spell examples. Explain how spellcasting can just vary.</li>
			<li>Create some Action examples. Explain how using skills in combat can just vary.</li>
			<li>Create a list of "Classes": basically an index that says "if you wanna play a wizard, pick such and such skills, and such and such mechanics". Same for Ancestries and Backgrounds.</li>
		</ul>
