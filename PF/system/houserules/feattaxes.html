            This rule is based on The World Is Square's <a href="http://theworldissquare.com/feat-taxes-in-pathfinder/">Feat Taxes in Pathfinder</a>, worth reading.<br/>
            Here are the rules found in the article, condensed and slightly modified.
        </div>

        <!--Free feats-->
        <h6>Free Feats</h6>
        <div class="float-right apartee">
            Stat prereqs are added in, they should be simple enough.<br/>
            <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/piranha-strike-combat">Piranha Strike</a>
            can still be taken by Dex-based chars, if they dump Str.
        </div>
        <div class="br">
            <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/power-attack-combat-final">Power Attack</a> (requires Str 13)<br/>
            <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deadly-aim-combat-final">Deadly Aim</a> (requires Dex 13)<br/>
            <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-expertise-combat-final">Combat Expertise</a> (requires Int 13)<br/>

        </div>

        <!--Fusion Feats-->
        <h6>Fusion Feats</h6>
        <div class="float-right apartee">
            Unlike what is suggested in the article,<br/>
            the feats listed here keep everything they previously had.<br/>
            For example, archers still get +1/+1 within 30ft.,<br/>
            and the total bonus against AoO is +5.
