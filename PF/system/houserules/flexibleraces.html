			This rule is based on a comment on some thread on
			<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/2kybpy/house_rule_thread_house_rule_thread/clpzu4z">reddit.com/r/pathfinder_rpg</a>
			about houserules. It was short, barely noticed, but inspiring. Thanks Reddit!

		<h2>Making Races Flexible</h2>
		<div class="float-right apartee">
			<b>Physical Stats:</b>
			STR, DEX, CON<br>
			<b>Mental Stats:</b>
			INT, WIS, CHA
		</div>
		<p>
			A large portion of races have +2 to a physical stat, +2 to a mental stat, and -2 to another stat.<br>
			<small>For example, Halflings have +2 dex, +2 cha, -2 str.</small>
		</p><p>
			With this rule, when choosing a race described above, you can choose to move one of your "+2".<br>
			If you move the +2 from a physical stat, you have to move it to a physical stat.<br>
			If you move the +2 from a mental stat, you have to move it to a mental stat.<br>
			<small>For example, Halflings could have +2 dex, +2 int, -2 str.</small>
		</p><p>
			This can be used to cancel out your penalty.<br>
			<small>For example, Halflings could have +2 cha and nothing else.</small>
		</p><p>
			Either the physical stat bonus or mental stat bonus can be moved, but not both. One has to stay.<br>
			The penalty cannot be moved. It can be filled as described above, but not moved.<br>
			If an alternate race trait would replace your bonus to a stat, you would not be considered a race with [+2p, +2m, -2] anymore, so this rule could not be used along with that alternate race trait.<br>
			The choice is made at character creation, and once it is made it cannot be changed, even by retraining.
		</p><p>
			If you are using this rule, you may be asked more details in the background of your character.
		</p>

		<!--Why-->
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>
			This rule is meant to encourage creative and new uses of the races.<br>
			It should make more colourful and varied characters, as well as break stereotypes about non-human races. Humans are defined by their variance, but members of other races aren't always exactly the same, either.<br>
			Also, humans still have the addictive advantage of an extra feat, I don't believe this makes them obsolete.
