		<section class="row">
			<dl>
				<dt>Skipper Gigglynose</dt>
				<dd>Arrives at the northern tavern late on the night before Christmas, looking for adventurers that can help.</dd>

				<dt>Molly Gingershoes</dt>
				<dd>Greets the adventurers at Santa's workshop. The magic to make truly helpful items is gone, but she will give each adventurer two items from <a href="https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?404819-List-of-100-mostly-useless-magic-items">the pile of rejects</a> in case they help.</dd>

				<dt>Carol Startoes</dt>
				<dd>A wheelchair-bound elf. She understands that the magic of the airship is the same as her wheelchair's: it's the <i lang="fr">Fée des Étoiles</i>!</dd>

				<dt>Bouncy Glittersun</dt>
				<dd>Chief of the elf militia fighting the gremlins, he helped Skipper escape.</dd>

				<dt>More?</dt>
				<dd><a href="https://www.imagineforest.com/blog/christmas-elf-name-generator/">Use this elf-name generator</a></dd>

				<dt>Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Dixen</dt>
				<dd>Reindeers</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>Mrs. Claus</dt>
				<dd>She is resisting with the rest of the elves.
					She's a gifted healer, so she's been healing all the elves she could.
					She can talk to animals: only her can convince the reindeers to bring players up to the airship.
					She has an empathic link with Santa, so she knows he's alive and in the airship, but not much more.
					She can explain to the players the <i lang="fr">Fée des Étoiles</i> has the power to transfer Santa's power.
					She's still a bit bitter at the <i lang="fr">Fée</i> for choosing her husband: she just wanted a  simple life!</dd>

				<dt lang="fr">La Fée des Étoiles</dt>
				<dd>She lives alone, so she was attacked first by Count Nezer and is dominated.
					Her magic powers the evil airship.
					She has been forced to transfer Santa's powers to Count Nezer: thus, he's the "Santa" that the children invite in their letters, and he can fly the magic sleigh.</dd>

				<dt>Nicholas "Santa" Claus</dt>
				<dd>Sequestered in the evil airship.
					He will fix the useless items the party got into something useable and awesome, if freed.
					He also knows a trick with fairy powder that can help the <i lang="fr">Fée des Étoiles</i> recover her senses.</dd>
