{
	"shortDecription": "Broken Crystal Ball",
	"longDecription": "A deep purple tablecloth covers a round table, in plain sight in this room. The moonlight gives an eery glowing tone to this purple, but a glittering catches your eye. On the floor right next to this table, the remains of a shattered crystal ball make the carpet a treacherous place to walk barefoot."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Shredded Bible",
	"longDecription": "In front of a small bookshelf, a flurry on loose pages lies on the ground, ripped with violence. The mangled book lies among them, thrown on the ground. You quickly recognize that it's a bible. Perhaps by coincidence, the first page on this book is now The Apocalypse."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Empty Noose",
	"longDecription": "Hanging from the ceiling, a noose greets you in this room. Though nobody has used the deadly instrument yet, a chair is upside-down nearby."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Broken Mirror",
	"longDecription": "A mirror, spanning a large portion of the wall, has been smashed into pieces. The debris have been left on the floor. Among them, you notice the object that has probably been used to break the mirror: a crucifix, with the upper part nearly torn appart."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Pentagram",
	"longDecription": "Nothing looked particularly wrong in this room until you tripped on a bump in the carpet. You find remains of wax from a candle underneath, at the end of one of a pentagram's branches. It was carefully hidden, fitting under the rug. You don't want to check, but it looks like it's been drawn with blood."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Bloody sink",
	"longDecription": "A sink in a corner of this room has a red tone, like a lot of blood has been poured in it. An unpleasant smell rises from it. You try to wash off the blood with some fresh water, but it's been there too long, and won't come off."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Will",
	"longDecription": "A writing desk has been cleaned in this room, and only a ream of paper lies on it, neatly stacked. It is a will, obviously left in hopes of being found by somebody."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Frog Idol",
	"longDecription": "In a darker corner of the room, you notice a weird statue, the size of a fist. It is shaped like a frog with its mouth open, showing its tongue, and it sits purposely on top of an end table. You want to pick it up, but it's slimy, as if it was covered in saliva. You decide to leave it there."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Ouija Board",
	"longDecription": "Furniture has been moved in this room to clear a large space in the middle, where a Ouija board has been placed on the floor. The planchette is nowhere to be found. A large knife has been planted in the middle of the board, and is still standing upright."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Mein Kampf",
	"longDecription": "A book was left on a side-table, next to a reading chair, with a bookmark about halfway through. You recognize the man on the cover before even reading the title: the book is Adolf Hitler's 'Mein Kampf'."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Empty Safe",
	"longDecription": "A portrait has been removed from its wall here, revealing a wall safe. The safe is open, and its key is still in the lock. It has been emptied, except for a small Four-leaf clover, encased in resin, the size of a thumb's nail."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Tarot Cards",
	"longDecription": "A tarot deck has been thrown on the floor of this room. However, two cards are aligned neatly on a low table: the Three of Swords and The Tower. Their drawings are grim, and the omen can't be good, but you see no reason why the rest of the deck was thrown on the floor. You also notice that, oddly, all the cards on the floor are face-down."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Photo Album",
	"longDecription": "A photo album was left open in a reading chair in this room. You glimpse the pictures of an unnamed baby inside it. The photo album only has a few page's worth of photos, and you find baby-sized mittens on the chair, under the album."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Eye in a Jar",
	"longDecription": "On a shelf in this room, inside a jar with a jelly-like liquid, is stored an eye, the size of a golf ball. After the initial shiver, you notice an odd detail: the jar has no cover. Even then, there is no smell, which is probably for the best."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Thousand Ants",
	"longDecription": "There is a large black spot on the floor, near the southern wall. You approach, fearing it might be blood, but it's a colony of ants, tightly packed. They are all dead and dried up, forming a dark patch of crusty corpses."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Model Ship",
	"longDecription": "Somebody has been taking apart a small model ship. One of the masts has been broken off, and you can see a secret compartment underneath. Of course, it's been emptied."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Book of Shadows",
	"longDecription": "A book was left on a side-table, next to a reading chair, with a bookmark about halfway through. It has an unmarked black cover. The top of the first page reads 'Book of Shadows', but everything else seems to be blank, even the bookmarked page."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Necronomicon",
	"longDecription": "A book was left on a side-table, next to a reading chair, with a bookmark about halfway through. Its old leather cover shows no name, but the first page clearly claims 'Necronomicon'. The rest of the page is illegible, and it would be a bad idea to read further."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Black Cat",
	"longDecription": "Inside a sheet that had been folded in two, left on the floor of this room, you find a swarm of flies and the body of a black cat. The impossible angle of his neck lets you imagine that it was choked to death."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Messy Room",
	"longDecription": "This room is an absolute mess. Everywhere you look, you find shredded paper, broken porcelain, upside-down chairs and tables. Maybe there was a fight here, or someone was desperately searching for something."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Pile of Ash",
	"longDecription": "On a chair in this room, you find a pile of ash. As you moved along in the room, the air current disturbed its rest, forming a medium-sized grey cloud. The cloud hurts your throat, so you step back."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Shaman Mask",
	"longDecription": "Right in the doorway as you were just stepping in this room, there was a hanging mask, of shamanic african inspiration. Its deep eyes are somewhat intimidating, even after the initial shock. You can't see any reason to why it's hanging in the doorway, but decide to leave it, just in case."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Address Book",
	"longDecription": "An address book is found, neatly displayed on a table. The handwriting inside looks like it might be the mansion's owner's, but you don't recognize any of the names, appart from yours."
},
{
	"shortDecription": "Rainbow Flag",
	"longDecription": "There is a trash can upside-down in a corner of this room. A quick glance lets you find a palm-sized rainbow-colored flag in it, a weird thing to throw away."
