	<!-- title FEATURES -->
	<div class="title newPage">FEATURES</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">AC Bonus (Ex)</div>
	<div>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMD.
		In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level.
		This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.
		These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed.
		He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Flurry of Blows (Ex)</div>
	<div>Starting at 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action.
		When doing so, he may make additional attacks, taking a –2 penalty on all of his attack rolls.
		These attacks can be any combination of unarmed strikes and attacks with a monk special weapon (he does not need to use two weapons to utilize this ability).
		For the purpose of these attacks, the monk's base attack bonus from his monk class levels is equal to his monk level.
		A monk applies his full Strength bonus to his damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands.
		A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows.
		A monk cannot use any weapon other than an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.
		A monk with natural weapons cannot use such weapons as part of a flurry of blows, nor can he make natural attacks in addition to his flurry of blows attacks.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Unarmed Strike</div>
	<div>A monk's attacks may be with fist, elbows, knees, and feet.
		This means that a monk may make unarmed strikes with his hands full.
		There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed.
		A monk may thus apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.
		Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll.
		He has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.
		A monk's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.
		A monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person of his size would.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Stunning Fist (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist.
		This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect.
		At 4th level, he can choose to make the target fatigued.
		At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute.
		At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds.
		At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target.
		At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds.
		The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made.
		These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature sickened by Stunning Fist cannot become nauseated if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Evasion (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 2nd level or higher, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks.
		If a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage.
		Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor.
		A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Fast Movement (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed.
		A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Manoeuver Training (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 3rd level, a monk uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus when calculating his Combat Maneuver Bonus.
		Base attack bonuses granted from other classes are unaffected and are added normally.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Still Mind (Ex)</div>
	<div>A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Ki Pool (Su)</div>
	<div>At 4th level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats.
		The number of points in a monk's ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier.
		As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike.
		At 4th level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
		At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
		At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
		At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
		By spending 1 point from his ki pool, a monk can do one of the following:
		Make one additional attack at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack, or
		Increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round, or
		Give himself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round.
		Each of these powers is activated as a swift action.
		The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Slow Fall (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent.
		When first gaining this ability, he takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.
		The monk's ability to slow his fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with his monk level until at 20th level he can use a nearby wall to slow his descent and fall any distance without harm.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">High Jump (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 5th level, a monk adds his level to all Acrobatics checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps.
		In addition, he always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using Acrobatics.
		By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk gains a +20 bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for 1 round.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Purity of Body (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Wholeness of Body (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds as a standard action.
		He can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to his monk level by using 2 points from his ki pool.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Improved Evasion (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves.
		He still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save.
		A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</div>

		Darius is courageous, but shy. He always wears old but well-kept clothing, fitting the theme of the monk.<br/>
		He gives great importance to hopes and dreams (but not night-dreams, he's not very much of a mystic). His motto is "You should never laugh at anyone's dreams."<br/>
		He will be prompt to ask "so... where are we going with this?" He's hindsight, but in the present.<br/>
