			<h1>Greytyphoon's Ludum Dare Index</h1>
		</header>
		<p>So this is a quick navigation page to the games I made for <a href="https://ldjam.com">Ludum Dare</a> competitions.</p>

		<h2><a href="32/Wait! Hear me out.jar">32 - Unconventional Weapon</a></h2>
		<p>This was the first game I completed, but the sounds weren't by me, so I didn't submit it.</p>

		<h2>34 - Growth || Two-button controls</h2>
		<p>I really failed on that one, trying to game a tree-growing game that went horribly wrong. Last one I made using libGDX, which is otherwise a nice lib.</p>

		<h2><a href="35/complete/index.html">35 - Shapeshift</a></h2>
		<p>I'm really proud of this little horror game I made. Shapeshifting, in this game, is the mansion changing when you're not looking. Made using pure, simple JS!</p>

		<h2><a href="38/index.html">38 - A Small World</a></h2>
		<p>Happy 15th birthday Ludumdare! I made this against all odds, finished with 6 minutes to spare.</p>
