// Harmony - Alliance - Obsession:
// Leana sees her work as "the best way she has of helping the world". "I'm good at this, and it's useful: why stop?"
// She seems a bit desperate at actually making a difference.
// She is the rallying point of the group, a cool-headed leader.
// She got this reputation by always having this soothing smile, and letting others talk it out at their pace.
// She is not a diplomat, though, and may fail as the group's leader, overboasting their acomplishments and accepting contracts that are too hard to handle.
// She thinks it's easy and best to ally with others. Not work together: ally. You've got my back, I've got yours.
// She met Corren first, when hunting down Gnolls in the forest north of Keesus.
// They ended up recruiting Darius before going Chimera-hunting in the nearby cliffsides, and Corren was gravely wounded in this adventure.
