				<summary class="subtitle">The Letters <b>2+</b></summary>
				<p>
					We must find, somewhere outside the car, a written word starting with A.
					License plates aren't words and don't count, but brand names do.
					When someone finds an A, we're all looking for B, etc.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Contact <b>3+</b></summary>
				<p>
					Two games in one.
					One player is the Leader, and gives a letter.
					Other players try to think of words that begin with that letter, and of obscure riddles to help other players guess.
					The goal is to have a fellow player understand what you mean, while the Leader doesn't.
				</p><p>
					<em>Example:</em> Leon the Leader gives the letter E.
					Alice is thinking of the word "Elephant", so she says "A big grey animal".
					Bob understands, and says "Contact!".
					Alice and Bob count "5, 4, 3...".
					Leon says "Elephant!".
					The hint was too obvious, the contact is broken, Alice and Bob must try something else.
				</p><p>
					<em>Example:</em> Leon the Leader is still waiting on the letter E.
					Bob is thinking of the word "Echography", so he says "Carol's appointment on next Saturday".
					Alice gets it, and says "Contact!".
					Leon doesn't understand, he doesn't even know Carol.
					Alice and Bob count "5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Echography!"
					The contact is successful, the letter is won, Leon will give a new letter.
				</p><p>
					Leon's letters, which he gives one at a time over contacts, actually spell a word.
					When someone guesses the overarching word, he becomes the new leader and the game starts again!
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Don't Get Me Started <b>2+</b></summary>
				<p>
					Taking turns, give one player a subject and he must go on an angry rant about that subject.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Never Have I Ever, themed edition <b>4+</b></summary>
				<p>
					Same as regular Never Have I Ever:
					Players take turns saying things they never did, and everyone who did must <s>take a shot</s> admit they did.
					If nobody did the thing, he who said it <s>takes the shot</s> is shamed.
					In this version, we set a "theme" for each round, to prevent every single question being sexual.
