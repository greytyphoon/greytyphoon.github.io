			<h1>Games within cars</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			Games that you can play during a long car ride.
		</p>

		<ul class="games">
			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">The Alphabet Game</summary>
				<p>
					We must find, somewhere outside the car, a written word starting with A.
					License plates aren't words and don't count, but brand names do.
					When someone finds an A, we're all looking for B, etc.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Contact</summary>
				<p>
					Two games in one.
					One player is the Leader, and gives a letter.
					Other players try to think of words that begin with that letter, and of obscure riddles to help other players guess.
					The goal is to have a fellow player understand what you mean, while the Leader doesn't.
				</p><p>
					<em>Example:</em> Leon the Leader gives the letter E.
					Alice is thinking of the word "Elephant", so she says "A big grey animal".
					Bob understands, and says "Contact!".
					Alice and Bob count "5, 4, 3...".
					Leon says "Elephant!".
					The hint was too obvious, the contact is broken, Alice and Bob must try something else.
				</p><p>
					<em>Example:</em> Leon the Leader is still waiting on the letter E.
					Bob is thinking of the word "Echography", so he says "Carol's appointment on next Saturday".
					Alice gets it, and says "Contact!".
					Leon doesn't understand, he doesn't even know Carol.
					Alice and Bob count "5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Echography!"
					The contact is successful, the letter is won, Leon will give a new letter.
				</p><p>
					Leon's letters, which he gives one at a time over contacts, actually spell a word.
					When someone guesses the overarching word, he becomes the new leader and the game starts again!
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Count to 10</summary>
				<p>
					The players must count from 1 to 10.
					The player who reaches 10 adds a rule that must be followed when counting one of the numbers (i.e. clap you hands when counting 5, or nine is pronounced <i>Nein</i>).
					When a player fails to follow a rule, the next player starts over from 1.
					The goal is to place a rule on all numbers and still reach 10.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Never Have I Ever</summary>
				<p>
					Players take turns saying things they never did, and everyone who did must <s>take a shot</s> admit they did.
					If nobody did the thing, the player who said it <s>takes a shot</s> is shamed.
					Set a "theme" for each round, to prevent every single question being sexual.
