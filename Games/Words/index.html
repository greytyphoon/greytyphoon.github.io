			<h1>Games with just words</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			So many games require just paper, pencils, and a word generator! Here's some inspiration for a game that's simple to play without much planning or material.
		</p>

		<ul class="games">
			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18723/aye-dark-overlord-the-red-box">Aye, Dark Overlord!</a></summary>
				<p>
					One player takes on the role of Rigor Mortis, the Dark Overlord, who finds that his diabolical schemes have once again been thwarted.
					The other players portray his cowering goblin servants, concocting ridiculous excuses to avoid the Overlord’s wrath.
					Each goblin player begins the game with three (secret) random words.
					When called upon to provide an explanation for their mistakes, the player must use one of those words and create a story.
					And it had better be good, since the Dark Overlord has no patience for stalling or boring stories.
					The Overlord will award Evil Looks&trade; to goblins who can't make up a credible alibi, and the first goblin to receive three Evil Looks&trade; loses the game.
					Be sure to roleplay for maximum fun!
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254640/just-one">Just One</a></summary>
				<p>
					A leader is chosen and looks away.
					One word is generated, revealed to all other players.
					Each player writes down a related word, a "hint" to help the leader guess the main word.
					The players share their word with each other: if a word is chosen by two players, it is removed!
					The leader comes back and sees all remaining words, and has one guess to find the main word.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/306169/match-5">Match 5</a></summary>
				<p>
					Generate 5 words for the group.
					Each player secretly writes 10 words, one for each possible combination of the five random words, without repeating.
					When all are done, compare answers.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/300753/cross-clues">Cross Clues</a></summary>
				<p>
					Generate 8 words for the group: four horizontally, four vertically.
					A leader is randomly, secretly assigned a place on the grid.
					They must say a single word associating the two ideas.
					The other players agree on what place on the grid it must represent.
					If they are right, mark off that place, it has been solved.
					If they are wrong, tally the mistakes.
					Try to fill the grid with as few mistakes as possible.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2281/pictionary">Pictionary</a></summary>
				<p>
					A leader secretly generates a word.
					They must draw, doodle, or sketch that word.
					They can't use letters or numbers.
					All other players try to guess what the leader is drawing.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/891/cranium">Cranium</a> - Blind Pictionary</summary>
				<p>
					Same as Pictionary, but the leader draws blindly.
					Obviously, much easier words should be used.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Cranium - Mime game</summary>
				<p>
					Same as Pictionary, but the leader must mime.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Cranium - Puppet game</summary>
				<p>
					Like the mime game, but another player is the Puppet, and the leader can't mime by themselves, they must move the Puppet.
					Obviously, easier words should be used.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Cranium - Humming game</summary>
				<p>
					A leader secretly generates a song title.
					They must hum, whistle, or otherwise perform that song.
					They can't use words or gestures (no singing or dancing).
					All other players try to guess what the leader is humming.
				</p>
				<p>You'll need a song generator. That's harder to find, but try <a href="https://binb.co/">binb</a>.</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1111/taboo">Taboo</a></summary>
				<p>
					A leader secretly generates a word.
					They give verbal clues to other players, but can't use the generated word.
					All other players try to guess what the leader is describing.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use <a href="http://playtaboogame.com/">this Taboo game</a> to also generate some added words to ban, for extra difficulty.
				</p>
			</details></li>

			<li><details>
				<summary class="subtitle">Don't Get Me Started</summary>
				<p>
					A leader generates a word. 
					They must go on an angry rant about that subject.
				</p>
			</details></li>
