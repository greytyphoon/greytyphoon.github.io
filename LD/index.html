        </div>
        So this is a quick navigation page to the games I made for <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> competitions.

        <h4><a href="32/Wait! Hear me out.jar">32 - Unconventional Weapon</a></h4>
        This was the first game I completed, but the sounds weren't by me, so I didn't submit it.

        <h4>33 - You are the monster</h4>
        I think I was busy through that one? I missed it.
        
        <h4>34 - Growth || Two-button controls</h4>
        I really failed on that one, trying to game a tree-growing game that went horribly wrong. Last one I made using libGDX, which is otherwise a nice lib.

        <h4><a href="35/complete/index.html">35 - Shapeshift</a></h4>
        I'm really proud of this little horror game I made. Shapeshifting, in this game, is the mansion changing when you're not looking. Made using pure, simple JS!

        <h4>36 - Ancient Technology</h4>
        I had a nice concept of a silly game where cavemen tried to build Wonders, and you'd have to direct them to make resources, but the cavemen would have drawbacks (Ugg can't carve stone good), and you'd have to waste some resources to make spears that you'd throw at the UFO to protect your building. It looked fun, but was too complicated, and not promising enough to keep working on it.
        
        <h4>37 - One Room</h4>
        Had something else that weekend... And the theme was rather uninspiring for me.

        <h4><a href="38/index.html">38 - A Small World</a></h4>
        Happy 15th birthday Ludumdare! I made this against all odds, finished with 6 minutes to spare.
