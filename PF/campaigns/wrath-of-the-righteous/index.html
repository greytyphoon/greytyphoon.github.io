		<h2>Playing the campaign</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The goal is to rush through the books, focusing mainly on fights.</li>
			<li>Mode sans merci. Le but du GM est de tuer, mais pas de TPK, idéalement tuant n-1 joueurs.</li>
			<li>"Quicksave" after each fight</li>
			<li>As soon as we have downtime & we are level 4+, start every fight fully healed</li>
			<li>No time limit on turns, mais on fait comme si</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Random traps will simply be skipped</li>
			<li>Puzzles can be skipped or not, at the GM's discretion.
				<small>After a while the GM should just give obvious hints to keep going.</small></li>
			<li>Random encounters will generally be skipped, at the GM's discretion.
				<small>Usually we keep if harder than average, story-important, or otherwise unique.</small></li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>We plan games far in advance, so there should rarely be any absent.</li>
			<li>If one player is absent, we play anyway. We might bring in a replacement.</li>
			<li>If two players are absent, cancel.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Hero Points</h2>
		<section class="row">
			<div>
				Our hero points can
				<ol>
					<li>auto-stabilize at 0 HP <small>monsters think you died</small>,</li>
					<li>reroll any d20, keep the new result.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div>
				Player reset at one hero points:
				<ol>
					<li>When a session starts,</li>
					<li>After every third encounter.</li>
				</ol>

		<h2>Character Creation</h2>

					<li>XP milestone</li>
					<li>2 traits, no drawbacks</li>
					<li>Only 1PP Paizo, no 3PP, no homebrew</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Wealth</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>We don't gain items from loot, searching, etc.</li>
					<li>We gain wealth by level.</li>
					<li>We gain it naturally, immediately when we level up.</li>
					<li>At level one, all characters have 175 gold.</li>
					<li>If your character has a spellbook and you want to learn more spells than those you would normally have by levelling up, you can.<br>
						Increase the cost of your spellbook by the cost of <a href="https://d20pfsrd.com/Magic/#TOC-Adding-Spells-to-a-Wizard-s-Spellbo">learning a spell of that level</a>.</li>
					<li>We can have up to 10% of total wealth as consumables.<br>
						These do not replenish between fights or during downtime.<br>
						On level up, the slate is cleaned. <small>New consumables can be purchased up to the new wealth by level.</small></li>
