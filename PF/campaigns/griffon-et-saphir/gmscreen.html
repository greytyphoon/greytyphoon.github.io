			<h3 title="100,000 years ago">The Era of Aboleths</h3>
			<p>An aboleth named <b>Pd'crizsm</b> failed to achieve godhood.
				He was chained at the heart of this world, cursed to remain there eternally.
				He decayed into a mass of his pure magic, corrupted and necromantic.
				(<a href="https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Moldering_Emperor">Moldering Emperor</a>, <a href="https://d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/neothelid">neothelid</a>)</p>
			<p><b>Conjunction of Spheres: Pain</b>
				Outsiders discovered this plane.
				<a href="https://d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/kyton">Kytons</a>
				felt the magic of the captive, tried to harness it, but were turned into eternal <a href="https://d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/runeslave-cr1">runeslaves</a>.
				They are currently mostly dormant, but still seek ways to free their master, though none seems to exist.</p>

			<h3 title="2,500 years ago">The Era of Drows</h3>
			<p>Drows arrived under the continent to expand the kingdom of <b>Queen Nephilim the Golden</b>.
				They were lead by <b>archmage Neb'sothar of Kosnom</b>, who had sensed a lot of power in the region and had advised his queen to expand in this region.
				Their expeditions were not very successful: many were corrupted with the black blood.
				Factions emerged:
				those who wished to help free their new patron,
				those who used their newfound magic to gain power to themselves,
				those who remained loyal despite their curse but were ostracized and isolated,
				those who seeked the "blessing" of the black blood,
				those who betrayed their queen under a new advantageous leadership,
				and those who kept serving their distant queen.</p>
			<p><b>Conjunction of the Spheres: Antagonists</b>
				Other races discovered this places.
				More elves arrived, and competing drows appeared.
				The Drow kingdom shattered, and abandonned this colony.</p>

			<h3 title="700 years ago">The Era of Outlaws</h3>
			<p>The forest had long been abandonned, thought to be "cursed".
				Bandits used it as a safe hiding spot, as the curse was safer for them than the law.
				A rebelious bandit leader emerged, and seceded from the established country: he became <b>King Elo√Øm the Faithful</b> under the patronage of <a href="https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gorum">Gorum</a>.
				His country was brutal.
				He harnessed Orcs as slaves, soldiers, and general labor.
				"Faithful" was his own chosen name, which he spread through propaganda: in truth, he was ruthless and feared.
				He was a <i>panem &amp; circense</i> kind of king, which both humans and orcs appreciated enough.
				Despite being on the surface (and not very interested in delving in ancien drow catacombs), still some were corrupted by the black blood.
				They were quickly sent to the circus.</p>
			<p>His son, <b>King Coramund the Beast</b>, was very similar, and just as lavish.
				He did not hold religion to the same standard, and his already not-very-erudite-or-religious kingdom became just a little more brutal.</p>
			<p><b>Conjunction of spheres: Bureaucrat</b> When travel was possible, <b>King Sigfried the Fair</b> tried explanding on other planes &mdash; and succeeded.
				Many of his warriors were moved to other planes were magic was more plentiful, the land was less hostile, and armies of vicious warriors ready to be magically enhanced were an unstoppable force.
				The king himself eventually moved to the new world.</p>
			<p>As the planes dissociated, his sister took up leadership.
				<b>Queen Deirdre the Stalwart</b> had a long life and worked tirelessly to reshape her kingdom, as the hardiest members had left in other planes, and new magic being available challenged her ruling.
				Her empire was much less vicious than her forefather's, but the base remained.
				Her son, set to inherit the throne, died at an early age.
				Agents of dissent saw their chance, and soon the old queen too died "in her sleep", leaving the leadership to <b>King Serge√Ø the Young</b>, her grandchild, at only 13 years old.
				Internal clans gained a lot of power, and the kingdom soon fractured, leaving alone the cursed forest.</p>

			<h3 title="500 years ago">The False Prophets</h3>
			<p>After a few generations of clan feud, a sect emerged.
				Lead by <b>Zola the Creator</b>(actually a powerful enchanter wizard), they emerged to unify clans peacefully while gaining power to themselves.
				They claimed to understand the mythical power at the heart of the forest.
				The other great leaders were <b>Ichao the defeated</b>, a half-elf oracle, <b>Vancian the lonely</b>, a female human golden dragon disciple, and <b>Bruxia the Wise</b>, a female damphir oracle.
				They were all magically bound to Zola and couldn't betray him, as a good cult needs solid unified leadership.
				The cult spoke of <b>Eldzale</b>, a mystic entity that was once an <a href="https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Eldest">Eldest</a>, whose body gave birth to the forest.</p>
			<p>Eventually, Zola got too greedy.
				Wanting to further prove that his cult was right, he dabbled in summoning outsiders that would agree and put on a show.
				He brought the Curse of Wendigo on himself somehow.
				His transformation was swift and devastating: cult members offered themselves to be devoured, convinced they would be reborn in him, but this only increased the monster's power.
				The other leaders trapped him, forming the totems, each giving their life in the process.
				No one believed this barrier would hold, and no god, angel, or even devil would approach the forest, sensing the darkest secrets underneath.
				This menace led to the whole plane being abandonned in the next conjunction of spheres.
				No great kingdom remained, decay and black magic were rampant, and civilization was tired.</p>
