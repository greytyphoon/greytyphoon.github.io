		<h2>Optional Rules - Not used unless specifically mentioned</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><h3><a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1328">Dual-Class PCs</a> <small><i>Gestalt</i></small></h3>
				<p>A classic very-high-power game.
					Most likely used at low player counts.
					<br>Note that because Dual-Class characters already get two class feats every even level, this rule generally replaces <i>Free Archetype</i>.</p></li>

			<li><h3><a href="https://cthulhuwiki.chaosium.com/rules/skill-rolls-and-difficulty-levels.html">Pushed Rolls</a> <small>from Call of Cthulhu</small></h3>
				<p>Outside of combat, when you fail at a roll, you can decide to push your luck.
					You must describe another way that you retry, giving it all you have.
					This allows you to reroll the initial failed roll.
					However, should you fail again, you automatically get a critical failure.
					You cannot push a roll again until another player pushes a roll.</p></li>

			<li><h3>Connections <small>from Traveller RPG</small></h3>
				<p>A character can become Trained in an extra skill at 1st level.
					It must be a skill that is related to, or used in, a shared history that this character has with another player character in the same game.
					Work with other players to create those stories, which happened off-screen, usually before the start of the campaign.</p></li>
