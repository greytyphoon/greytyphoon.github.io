			<h1>Quartz Junkie Instinct</h1>
			Homebrewed Barbarian Instinct for PF2
		</header>

		<p>Your rage is powered by an addictive steroid known as "Quartz Salt" <small><i lang="fr">"sel de quartz"</i></small>.
			You consume it to bolster your physical strength to ridiculous levels, with little regard to the damage to your body.</p>

		<h2>Instinct Ability: Steroid Rage</h2>
		<p>When you <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=2802">Rage</a>, you can consume a dose of Quartz Salt.
			You must be <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2207">wearing</a> it, like any toolkit, but it doesn't require a free hand to consume.
			If you do, attempt a <b>DC 6</b> flat check.</p>
		<p><em>Critical</em> — Increase Rage damage to 6. Ignore Rage's 1 minute cooldown.<br>
			<em>Success</em> — Increase Rage damage to 4. Ignore Rage's 1 minute cooldown.<br>
			<em>Failure</em> — You generate a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=104">Wellspring Surge</a>, with a spell rank of half your level, rounded up.<br>
			<em>Fumble</em> — [<a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=654">Misfortune</a>] As failure, but you roll twice, with the GM choosing the worse effect.</p>

		<h2>Extra Feats</h2>
		<p>All feats from the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=104">Wellspring Mage</a> Archetype count as Barbarian feats of the same level for you.</p>

		<h2>Anathema</h2>
		<p class="condensed">Selling or giving away Quartz Salt is anathema to your instinct, as you hoard it for yourself.
			Also anathema is dispelling the effect of a Wellspring Surge, unless it is both permanent and harmful, as you believe these are part of the experience and keep your senses sharp.
			This includes Surges triggered on others, or through other means than Quartz Salt.
			This applies only to <em>dispelling</em>; it is not anathema to defeat a foe summoned by a Surge, to cut hair turned blue by a Surge, or to replace a weapon turned into a chicken by a Surge.</p>

		<h2>Specialization Ability — 7th</h2>
		<p>Increase Rage damage to 5.<br>
			When you use Quartz Salt, the flat check is <b>DC 5</b>.<br>
			If you get a <b>Critical</b> on that check, increase Rage damage to 10.<br>
			If you get a <b>Success</b> on that check, increase Rage damage to 8.</p>

		<h2>Raging Resistance — 9th</h2>
		<p>You resist piercing, mental, and spirit damage.</p>
		
		<h2>Greater Specialization Ability — 15th</h2>
		<p>Increase Rage damage to 12.<br>
			When you use Quartz Salt, the flat check is <b>DC 4</b>.<br>
			If you get a <b>Critical</b> on that check, increase Rage damage to 18.<br>
			If you get a <b>Success</b> on that check, increase Rage damage to 16.</p>

			<hr>
			<p>This addictive steroid is refined from mineral deposits found around the desert near Alkenstar.
				It induces mild euphoria and enhances physical strength in short term.
				This would make it a favorite of the hard-working crews of labourers around the city, but its semi-magical nature means it can react to the Mana Storms of the region, sometimes causing chaotic magical surges.</p>
			<p><b>Special:</b> Because this substance's effects depend on the user, the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Diseases.aspx?ID=15">save against addiction</a>
				of this drug is a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2629">DC of the user's level</a>, not of this item's level.</p>
