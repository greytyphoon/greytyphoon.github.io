		<div><b>Usage</b> etched onto a weapon; <b>Bulk</b> &mdash;</div>
		<hr>

		<p>Gattlebee's research on oozes produced this odd improvement on a regular ooze-<a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1041">bane</a> rune.</p>

		<p>The etched weapon adds <u>1d6 dmg</u> of the weapon's damage type to creatures with the [<a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=665">ooze</a>] trait.
			This additional damage can never be resisted, halved, or prevented.</p>

		<p>If the ooze resists the weapon's damage type, the weapon's wielder <em>may choose to</em> instead deal <u>Nd4 + 1d6 dmg</u> to the ooze, bypassing any resistance, where N is the normal number of weapon damage dice.
			Do not add Strength or Weapon Specialization to this number, nor any other bonuses to damage from Rage, Sneak Attack, Courageous Anthem or any spells, etc.
			This number already includes the oozebane rune's 1d6 additional damage.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, when striking an Ooze that can Split, the weapon's wielder <em>may choose to</em> attempt a <u>DC 7</u> flat check.</p>
		<p><em>Critical</em> — The ooze cannot split until the beginning of its next turn.<br>
			<em>Success</em> — The triggering Strike cannot cause the ooze to split.<br>
			<em>Failure</em> — No effect.<br>
			<em>Fumble</em> — The ooze immediately splits, even if the triggering Strike would not normally have caused it.
				<small>If the ooze was unable to split because of a previous critical effect of this rune, instead it immediately regains the ability to split, then splits only if the triggering Strike would have caused it.</small></p>
