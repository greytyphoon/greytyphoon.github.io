	<!-- title FEATURES -->
	<div class="title newPage">FEATURES</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Arcane Pool (Su)</div>
	<div>At 1st level, the magus gains a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that he can draw upon to fuel his powers and enhance his weapon.
		This arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/2 his magus level (minimum 1) + his Intelligence modifier.
		The pool refreshes once per day when the magus prepares his spells.
		At 1st level, a magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute.
		For every four levels beyond 1st, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level.
		These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5.
		Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.
		At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal.
		Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier.
		These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack.
		If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added.
		These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability.
		These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.
		A magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time.
		If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Spell Combat (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 1st level, a magus learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time.
		This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast.
		To use this ability, the magus must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand.
		As a full-round action, he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a -2 penalty
		and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty).
		If he casts this spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his attack rolls, up to his Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on his concentration check.
		If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty.
		A magus can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if he has more than one attack, he cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Spellstrike (Su)</div>
	<div>At 2nd level, whenever a magus casts a spell with a range of "touch" from the magus spell list, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack.
		Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell.
		If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell.
		If the magus makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks.
		This attack uses the weapon's critical range, but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="specialreference">Swashbuckler's Derring-Do (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 1st level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point when she makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check.
	She can do this after she makes the check but before the result is revealed.
	If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check.
	She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="specialreference">Swashbuckler's Opportune Parry and Riposte (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 1st level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the swashbuckler,
	she can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack.
	The swashbuckler makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity;
	for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler takes a -2 penalty on this roll.
	If her result is greater than the attacking creature's result, the creature's attack automatically misses.
	The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the creature's attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made.
	Upon performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point,
	the swashbuckler can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Spell Recall (Su)</div>
	<div>At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells he has already cast.
		With a swift action he can recall any single magus spell that he has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1).
		The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="specialreference">Precise Strike (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point,
	a swashbuckler gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon (though not natural weapon attacks),
	adding her swashbuckler level to the damage dealt.
	To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield other than a buckler.
	She can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her.
	Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike,
	and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike.
	This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't multiplied on a critical hit.
	As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to double her precise strike's damage bonus on the next attack.
	This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost.
	This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of panache points a deed costs (such as the Signature Deed feat).</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Knowledge Pool (Su)</div>
	<div>At 7th level, when a magus prepares his magus spells, he can decide to expend 1 or more points from his arcane pool, up to his Intelligence bonus.
		For each point he expends, he can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in his spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day.
		If he does not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time he prepares spells, he loses those spells.
		He can also cast spells added in this way using his spell recall ability, but only until he prepares spells again.</div>
	<br/>
	<div class="special">Improved Spell Combat (Ex)</div>
	<div>At 8th level, the magus's ability to cast spells and make melee attacks improves.
		When using the spell combat ability, the magus receives a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks, in addition to any bonus granted by taking an additional penalty on the attack roll.</div>

		Harmony - Alliance - Obsession:<br/>
		Leana sees her work as "the best way she has of helping the world". "I'm good at this, and it's useful: why stop?"<br/>
		She seems a bit desperate at actually making a difference.<br/>
		<br/>
		She is the rallying point of the group, a cool-headed leader.<br/>
		She got this reputation by always having this soothing smile, and letting others talk it out at their pace.<br/>
		She is not a diplomat, though, and may fail as the group's leader, overboasting their acomplishments and accepting contracts that are too hard to handle.<br/>
		<br/>
		She thinks it's easy and best to ally with others. Not work together: ally. You've got my back, I've got yours.<br/>
		<br/>
		She met Corren first, when hunting down Gnolls in the forest north of Keesus.<br/>
		They ended up recruiting Darius before going Chimera-hunting in the nearby cliffsides, and Corren was gravely wounded in this adventure.
