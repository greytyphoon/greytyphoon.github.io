			<h1>Games with just cards</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			Endless fun can be had with a deck of fifty-four cards!
			Many sites, like <a href="https://www.pagat.com/">Pagat.com</a>, have great selections and ideas to offer.
			However, I prefer coop games, where everyone wins or loses together, and these are hard to come by.
			Here are a few, to make sure I'll never lose them.
		</p>
		<p>Games listed here will never require more than a regular deck of cards, paper, pencils, some sort of tokens (coins?) and regular six-sided dices.</p>

				<summary class="subtitle">Portraits <b>1-4</b></summary>
				<p>The single-player version can be found on <a href="https://www.pagat.com/invented/portraits.html">Pagat.com: Portraits</a>.</p>
				<p>For a coop game, simply give each player their own line of 5 assets.
					The players then take turns trading and/or swapping with the public and private markets.
					Players are allowed to swap assets <b>of equal value</b> with each other at any time, without using their action.</p>
				<p><b>Easier:</b> Players can buy assets (not portraits!) from the public market by paying with cards from any suits.</p>
				<p><b>Harder:</b> Swapping cards between players uses your action.</p>

				<summary class="subtitle">4&times;4 Rummy <b>1-4</b></summary>
				<p>Idea suggested by many people on forums, and the only version I found is
					<a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2017/01/rules-for-cooperative-poker-janjam17/">this guy who doesn't know what he's talking about</a>.
					So I made my own.</p>
				<p><b>Setup:</b> Deal 4 cards to each player, and place 4 cards in the corners of a 4&times;4 grid in the middle.</p>
				<p>The aim is to clear the table. If at any moment the table is empty, the players win.</p>
				<p>Players take turns adding cards to the table.
					They may add only one card, and it must be adjacent to a card on the table.
					If they complete a serie, they may remove all cards of that serie from the table.
					They then draw a card, filling their hand back to 4 cards.</p>
				<p>Series in this game can be triplets (three cards of the same rank in a row, like 7♥ 7♣ 7♠),
					sequences (three cards of increasing ranks in a row, like 9♦ 10♥ J♦),
					or the same series with 4 cards in a row instead.
					Aces can be lower than 2 or higher than kings, but not both (A♠ 2♥ 3♣ and Q♣ K♠ A♦ are valid, K♣ A♠ 2♣ is not).</p>
				<p>The deck will not be reshuffled. Once the end is reached, players will stop drawing cards; when no player has cards left, the game is over and the players lose.</p>
				<p><b>Easier:</b> Add jokers to the deck. They are wildcards and can complete any serie, but they cannot be used in a serie that would remove the last card from the table.</p>
				<p><b>Harder:</b> Each player's hand size is 3, not 4.</p>

				<p>A pandemic game about social distancing!</p>
				<p><b>Setup:</b> Separate the suits into four decks (<i>regions</i>) and take out the Aces (<i>hospitals</i>). Shuffle the Jokers in two decks.</p>

				<p>Interesting, need to try it.</p>

				<summary class="subtitle">Coop Oh Hell! <b>3-7</b></summary>
				<p>The competitive version can be found on <a href="https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html">Pagat.com: Oh Hell!</a>.</p>
				<p>Everyone knows how to play a this game, or a variant:
					there's a trump suit,
					you bet how many rounds you'll win,
					a leading player plays a card and others must try to follow suit,
					then the highest trump/highest leading suit wins,
					and the winning player leads the next round.</p>
				<p>In the coop version, players should still hide their hand and avoid discussing specifics,
					but the number of bets MUST be equal to the number of cards in each player's hands,
					and players only reduce the number of cards in their hands for the next draft if everyone's bet was exact.
					The players win if they can collectively reach zero cards in hand.</p>
				<p><b>Harder:</b> Track lives! Start with 5, lose one life if bets were incorrect, and gain one if bets were exact (in addition to moving down the number of cards). Don't reach 0!</p>

				<summary class="subtitle">Eleusis <b>3-7</b></summary>
				<p>Originally found on <a href="http://www.logicmazes.com/games/eleusis/express.html">LogicMazes.com: Eleusis</a>
					and on <a href="https://www.pagat.com/eights/eleusis.html">Pagat.com: Eleusis</a>.</p>
				<p>It's a classic game, where a leader secretly makes up a rule about which cards can be played, and the other players attempt to play cards or to guess the rule.</p>
				<p><b>Setup:</b> Deal 7 cards to each player, and start the mainline with a single card.</p>
				<p>Players take turns attempting to play a card: the leader tells them if it's right or not.
					Each correctly played card continues the mainline horizontally, wrong guesses are added vertically.
					If a players plays correctly, he is given a chance to guess the rule;
					If he played incorrectly, he draws another card to replace the one he played.</p>
				<p>The game is won when a player guesses the rule, or when a player managed to play all his cards. The game is lost when a player should draw a card but can't, because the deck is empty.</p>
